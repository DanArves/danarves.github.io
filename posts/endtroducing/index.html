		<h4><i>Magazine Recommends…</i>&nbsp; <b>Endtroducing</b></h4>
		<p>Its title is apt in that this is the first, and last, album by DJ Shadow.  Let us qualify that a little:  Yes the artist has produced records since, and with more than a few fine tracks on them, but none were quite <em>that</em> album.  According to the DJ himself that is by design:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Repeat Endtroducing over and over again?  That was never, ever in the game plan.  Fuck that.  So I think it&rsquo;s time for certain fans to decide if they are fans of the album, or the artist.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which <strong>Magazine</strong> feels is fair enough, we&rsquo;re overwhelmingly grateful in the first place simply for the album&rsquo;s existence itself.<br>
It is hard to dispute that Endtroducing is a massive achievement, purely on a technical level.  Even if you don&rsquo;t like the music - you are entitled to not do so - the composition by intricate selection, editing and assemblage of a myriad samples recorded from vinyl records over a period of two years (using the legendary Akai MPC60 sampling workstation) deserves more than a little respect.  To a lover of the collage that it is, this also goes some way to explaining how what is effectively a solo production effort can be the subject of such effusive fanboi fawning about its aural wonder.  Because it isn&rsquo;t.<br>
Hold up - roll up.<br>
Most highly praised or appreciated works comprise of the input of a whole plethora numbered by writers, performers, engineers, producers and technicians.  Screw ‘too many cooks’ - the combined efforts of a highly <em>orchestrated</em> collective is insufficient, but mostly necessary for, the creation of a Great Work of Art™.  Even if their part is minimal, each of the many hands a work passes through polish or round off one aspect or dimension, creating pebbles from rocks.<br>
The DJ isn&rsquo;t  *ahem*  over-Shadowed by the realisation that his role here is actually one of a conductor as much as a composer - the multitude of personnel involved in each of the cuts from which the album is derived in effect makes it the collaboration of a huge sprawling morass over time and place and exactly explains - the DJ&rsquo;s achievement in no way undermined - why we say: go listen.  Go figure.</p>
