		<h4><i>Magazine Recommendsâ€¦</i>&nbsp; <b>Gabbeh</b></h4>
		<p>This time, we divert somewhat from albums to films made in the 90&rsquo;s.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I first came across this film in the early 2000&rsquo;s on late night T.V.<br>
For years it was lost to me, just a wistful lost encounter, until by happenstance I found it again years later</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A full feast, a journey, a mystery, a loss and a gain, this film is an obscure treasure - being mostly unknown outside the realm of what is known as world cinema.Â  A meditative piece that is at odds with the hyper-action of the typical cinematic experience.Â  Infused with the ultra-poetic spirit of Iran where it is set, it is an elergy and a song to love, travails, longing and tradition.Â  A tradition of crafts, animals, journeys; but also one that traps and confines, divides the lovers, and - once the break is made - creates a new parting of sorrow, the fleeing into shame and an ostracised existence.Â  This is the central romance of the film: the price of true love.</p>
<p>The gabbeh of the title is a rug, woven throughout, with the emblem, the motif, the two lovers eloping on horseback knitted into a sea of blue that could be sky, or land, or water.</p>
<p>One favourite scene is to witness a grown man dancing, singing, skipping about during marriage preparations. A rural, coarse and long distant innocence of sorts.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t watch this, unless you can meet its breadth and swathe. Leave it be if you are hardened and cynical. For the Gabbeh is a ghost in primary colours, a dream on celluloid, a departure and a stop.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you ignore our dire warnings and persist, the dazzling mise-en-scÃ¨ne A Taste of Cherry and the puzzling A Moment of Innocence are both visual and dramatic spectacles to match, each with a mischevious turn, pushing at the notorious fourth wall with a carefree abandon.</p>
<p>All three films are out of copyright and available to watch online for free. Something to put the step into your Spring season ðŸ™‚</p>
