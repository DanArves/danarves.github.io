		<p>Rain. The heavy pitter-patter outside. On the roof. In the garden. On the terrace. Filling what it can and running down, over, around what it can&rsquo;t.<br>
And it doesn&rsquo;t matter now. From the flat roof, yesterday I could see far across and I saw a light wink out in the dusk. Too bad, too good, too gone.</p>
<p>Around here the heat hung above the sky with the haze that turned all the sunsets orange. It fell with the night, like now, descending in a wave making all sweat before it. Except tonight. For the rain.<br>
I can&rsquo;t pretend I didn&rsquo;t feel anything, and who would miss a knife that had been withdrawn from the wound? No, you wouldn&rsquo;t, but you&rsquo;d feel its absence. It came, it went, and left a memory in its wake.</p>
<p>On Saturday I would go down to the river. It&rsquo;s far enough from these low hot hills, not out of sight, but far enough. To be away. But this is my home at least for now and of course I can bear the yard and the abundant verdant vines, the crunch of gravel and the breeze that picks up in the late evening. Sometimes.</p>
<p>Because just a day or two ago it wasn&rsquo;t there. And oh we suffered. I sat beside the bath, dipping my head into a water filled tub and letting it drip from my hair to the floor boards and thin rug.</p>
<p>Now there was no one except strange beetles for company, but I was healing, or the surf hadn&rsquo;t crashed in my heart. One of the two.</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m not making sense. Maybe I don&rsquo;t expect to. Maybe I made the most sense I ever have and this summer I sank it, an ace from an empty sleeve - I wore t-shirts - slapped down and a cheer from an empty room.</p>
<p>Yeah the door had closed. But mine was now open and I could see, and hear, the heavy pitter-patter outside. Rain</p>
