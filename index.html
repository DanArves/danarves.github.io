			<p>Rain. The heavy pitter-patter outside. On the roof. In the garden. On the terrace. Filling what it can and running down, over, around what it can&rsquo;t.
And it doesn&rsquo;t matter now. From the flat roof, yesterday I could see far across and I saw a light wink out in the dusk. Too bad, too good, too gone.
Around here the heat hung above the sky with the haze that turned all the sunsets orange.</p>

			<p>I get so emotional sometimes&hellip;
I had arrived at the hospital to visit a friend. I hadn&rsquo;t seen her for 14 years before the previous time which was some months ago. And now I wanted to visit - as at our age you never know.
There were freshly planted trees dotted across the plaza. They were mere saplings - young upstarts - and the delicate pale leaves fluttered slightly in a breeze that wasn&rsquo;t there.</p>

			<p>Mugs we have known and loved.
This useful mug follows the typical wider, slightly shorter bone-china format of recent decades and has done good service in its capacity as a beverage conveyor.
While we lament the rarity of the more classic, refined ‘soho’ shape - with its eminently drinkable curled lip, narrower hand-fitting body and slight height advantage - we also ‘drink from the wine available’ and have not been disappointed in this mug as a day-to-day performer.</p>

			<p>Last autumn, for some reason the thought occurred to delve into the famous late author&rsquo;s work for the first time. It may have something to do with the noble Carne Ross, whose work we were also exploring. Yes, the book A Delicate Truth is reputedly, and partly, based on the truth-seeking, campaigning diplomat whose interesting TEDx talk “The Accidental Anarchist” has received over one hundred thousand views.
For our first dip we chose the aforementioned work, along with an earlier mid-period classic Our Game.</p>

			<p>Hey there!
Our resident nerd, who shall remain nameless&hellip; made this site using the Hugo framework.
Earlier this morning they had this to say about the experience:
Hugo is what&rsquo;s known as a framework, which come in various forms and assist in building a website. For this site we had a basic pre-existing design written in plain html/css and the brief was to take away the tedious task of manually editing code for each post and be able to make quick simple changes across the site.</p>
