      <description>Mugs we have known and loved.
This useful mug follows the typical wider, slightly shorter bone-china format of recent decades and has done good service in its capacity as a beverage conveyor.
While we lament the rarity of the more classic, refined ‘soho’ shape - with its eminently drinkable curled lip, narrower hand-fitting body and slight height advantage - we also ‘drink from the wine available’ and have not been disappointed in this mug as a day-to-day performer.</description>
